# [2.0.0]
## Changed
- Download emoji list from https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-11.0/full-emoji-list.html instead of emojipedia, as that one didn't work at all anymore

## Added
- Downloading, parsing and extracting emoji properties from https://unicode.org/Public/emoji//11.0/emoji-data.txt so that we can find "human" emojis for skin color selection
