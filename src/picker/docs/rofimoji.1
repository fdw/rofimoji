Choose what to do with the selected characters: Directly type them with
the \(lqTyper\(rq, copy them to the clipboard using the
\(lqClipboarder\(rq, or insert them indirectly using the clipboard.
To use the compose key functionality, choose
\(lqtype\-numerical:.\(rqunicode\(rq will type the unicode codepoints of
the chosen characters, \(lqcopy\-unicode\(rq will copy it.
\(lqprint\(rq just outputs them on stdout.
If you want to decide spontanously, use \(lqmenu\(rq.

.TP
\-\-files \f[I]FILE\f[R] [\f[I]FILE\f[R] \&...], \-f \f[I]FILE\f[R] [\f[I]FILE\f[R] \&...]
Read characters from this file (or these files), one entry per line.
Absolute and relative paths are supported, as is globbing
(\f[CR]\-\-files /home/you/characters.csv ../other*.csv\f[R]).
A filename without extension is enough
(\f[CR]\-\-files musical_symbols supplemental_arrows\f[R]) for included
character files and all in \f[CR]${XDG_DATA_HOME}/rofimoji/data\f[R].
Here, too, globbing is supported and done by default.
In the config file, several files need to be listed as
\f[CR]files=[_FILE_, _FILE_]\f[R].

Config file syntax allows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for
details, see syntax at
